# ðŸ¤– LinkedIn AI ChatBot

This project is an AI-powered chatbot built to answer questions about my professional background, skills, projects, and experience â€” everything youâ€™d normally find on my LinkedIn profile.

Instead of scrolling through LinkedIn, you can chat directly with this bot. It uses OpenAIâ€™s large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate, professional, and conversational answers tailored to my career profile.

Itâ€™s like having a conversational version of my LinkedIn profile, available anytime.

## ðŸ”Ž How It Works

Profile Data Extraction

My LinkedIn profile and resume are stored as PDFs and text files.

These documents are parsed and processed into clean text.

Knowledge Embedding

The extracted text is summarized and structured.

Relevant data is provided to the chatbot as context for accurate responses.

AI-Powered Responses

The chatbot is powered by OpenAIâ€™s GPT models.

It stays in character, answering questions as if you were speaking with me directly.

Interactive Chat Interface

Built with Gradio, so you can interact through a clean, simple web interface.

âš¡ This setup allows recruiters, collaborators, or potential clients to ask questions and get meaningful answers â€” without needing to dig through my LinkedIn profile.
